The general way of making a Czech diphone voice is described in voice-czech-ph
package.  This document describes how these new Czech voices were processed.
This process was simplified because we received the recordings with diphone
boundaries already labeled.

* Copying the recording

The received *.wav files were renamed appropriately and put into `wav'
subdirectory.  The received diphone index with timings was converted to
Festival + Festival Czech notation and put to dic/krbdiph.est.  It may be
necessary to invert the WAV files, e.g. using sox like:

  $ sox -v -1 INPUT.wan OUTPUT.wav

* Generating the #-# diphone (silence)

Sox options have changed since voice-czech-ph so we must use modify the sox
command line:

  $ dd if=/dev/zero of=krb0000.raw bs=100000 count=1
  $ sox -r 32k -e signed -b 16 -c 1 krb0000.raw krb0000.wav

* Looking for pitchmarks

Using the copied scripts from voice-czech-ph:

  $ export ESTDIR=/usr
  $ export FESTVOXDIR=...path-to-source-directory.../festvox
  $ mkdir pm
  $ ./tools/make_pm_wave wav/*.wav
  $ ./tools/make_pm_fix pm/*.pm

It may be necessary to change PM_ARGS in ./tools/make_pm_wave.

* Generating LPC parameters

tools/make_lpc script was copied from voice-czech-ph and -lpc_order parameter
was adjusted according to the recording sampling rate.  Then the script was
run:

  $ export ESTDIR=/usr
  $ export FESTVOXDIR=...path-to-source-directory.../festvox
  $ mkdir lpc
  $ ./tools/make_lpc wav/*.wav

* Creating the voice definition file

`festvox' directory was created.  The language definition file in it was copied
and renamed from its voice-czech-ph counterpart.  Everything in it was renamed
from `ph' to `krb'.  Additionally f0_mean was adjusted, to a common frequency
of the recording determined by examining some *.wav file using a sound editor.
f0_std was also adjusted in accordance with the f0_mean change.

* Creating Makefile

Makefile and make-group.scm files were copied from voice-czech-ph and adjusted.
Especially everything about power factors was removed from Makefile as we
hadn't adjusted power factors in this recording.
