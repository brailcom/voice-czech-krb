Installation instructions for voice-czech-krb
=============================================

* Prerequisities

Building this voice was tested with Festival 2.0.95 and 2.1.
Using this voice was tested with Festival 2.0.95.

voice-czech-krb contains just a Czech voice.  To synthesize something, you need
festival-czech package providing Czech support for Festival.  festival-czech is
available from http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-czech .  To install it, follow
its installation instructions.

* Building the voice

If you install from the binary distribution, skip this step.

In order to build the voice data, make sure you have the following additional
software installed:

- Edinburgh Speech Tools (Debian package speech-tools).

- Festival 2.0.95 or later; earlier versions might work but were not tested
  (Debian package festival)

Then just invoke `make'.  If it fails, it is most likely because you don't have
installed all the tools mentioned above or you don't have properly set and
exported the environment variable ESTDIR (it should point to the Edinburgh
Speech Tools).

On Debian, it usually suffices to just set ESTDIR to /usr, i.e.

ESTDIR=/usr make

* Installing the voice

Run `make install'.  To adjust the installation path, use the festival_voices_path
Makefile variable, e.g.:

make install festival_voices_path=/usr/local/share/festival/voices

The default (when you do not specify the variable) is
/usr/share/festival/voices.

If you don't have installed the standard English Festival voice or if you want
to set this Czech voice as the default Festival voice, add the following line
to one of the Festival initialization files (usually /etc/festival.scm for
system wide settings or ~/.festivalrc for user specific settings):

  (set! voice_default 'voice_czech_krb)

* Running the voice

Start Festival and call:

  (voice_czech_krb)

Now Festival should speak Czech!
